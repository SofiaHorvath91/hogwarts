        <div class="row container-row">
            <br>The Black Lake, alternatively known as the Great Lake, is the large, cold lake, freshwater and
            landlocked, located to the south of Hogwarts Castle.
            It is about half a mile in diameter and the castle's plumbing network drains into it.
            <br>As the grounds and waters of Hogwarts function partly as a nature reserve for magical creatures
            which have difficulty existing in Muggle-inhabited areas,
            there are Grindylows (vicious little water demons), Selkies (of a hardy Scottish strain) and also a
            giant squid in the lake. This latter one is semi-domesticated and permits students to tickle its tentacles
            on sunny days, when it basks in the shallows. The giant squid also serves as occasional life-saver for
            students who fall in the lake.
            <br>The Black Lake also gives home to the Black Lake Merpeople colony, consisting of hundreds of
            merpeople, who are just rarely seen above, but helps to keep control over the beasts of the
            lake.<br><br>

            <br>The Entrance Gates are made of magnificent wrought iron and are flanked by two columns topped with
            statues of winged boars. The winged hogs on either side of the Hogwarts gate are a fanciful version of the
            old saying "When pigs fly," meaning something that is impossible. To Muggles, magic is impossible, but not
            at Hogwarts. Just a few yards from the gates is a small guardhouse with a tall chimney.
            As the all of the Hogwarts Grounds are protected by powerful magic, the Entrace Gates is the main guarded
            entry point for visitors. Students also leave here to visit Hogsmeade village.<br><br>

        <div class="row container-row">
            <br>The Forbidden Forest, also known as the Dark Forest, borders the edges of the Hogwarts Grounds.
            The forest is a very old place that holds many secrets and houses many creatures, some dark and dangerous,
            others friendly. It is thick with dense, ancient trees — beech, oak, pine, sycamore, and yew are mentioned,
            as well as undergrowth such as knotgrass and thorns — but there are paths, brooks, and some clearings. Off
            the path the way is almost impassable.
            <br>The forest is home to a wide and strange assortment of magical creatures beside the normal, non-magical
            inhabitants - anything wild and/or dangerous that needs a place to live is put there.
            The forest's magical population includes unicorns, acromantulas, thestrals, centaurs, trolls and werewolfs,
            and even a wild flying Ford Anglia. There are areas around the edges of the forest that are part of the
            Hogwarts grounds, but which are out of sight of the castle.
            <br>As the forest's name suggests, it is strictly off limits to students — except in the case of detention,
            or Care of Magical Creatures lessons that occasionally take place there.<br><br>

            They are home to many exotic and magical plants including some that are extremely rare, difficult to
            cultivate and maintain, or even dangerous, such as the Venomous Tentacula.<br><br>

        <div class="row container-row">
            <br>Hogsmeade Village, or simply called Hogsmeade, is the only all-wizarding village in Britain.
            According to tradition, Hogsmeade was founded over a thousand years ago, around the same time as the school,
            by medieval wizard Hengist of Woodcroft as he was fleeing persecution by Muggles. It is a picturesque little
            village of cottages and shops, with enchanted candles hanging in the trees during the holidays. It is also
            near the location of the train station used by the Hogwarts Express.
            <br>Since 1714 (when the 1714 Edict was passed), Hogwarts third years and above have been permitted weekend
            trips into the village. Mainly, students frequent the High Street in the village which contains the named
            specialty shops and pubs such as Zonko's Joke Shop and Honeydukes. Otherwise, they wander on to observe the
            infamous Shrieking Shack.<br><br>

            <br>Hogsmeade station is the platform where the Hogwarts Express ends its journey north from Platform
            Nine-And-Three-Quarters. It serves both the village of Hogsmeade and Hogwarts School.
            <br>The station is located near the Black Lake, and from there a road extends around the lake to Hogwarts
            Castle. It is actually quite the distance from the village itself, being on the opposite side of the
            Hogwarts grounds. At the end of the platform, boats are docked awaiting the arrival of Groundskeeper to take
            the First years to the castle across the lake. For the students of Year Two - Year Seven, "horseless"
            carriages (actually pulled by Thestrals) are lining up next to the station for reaching the castle by a
            small road around the lake.<br><br>

        <div class="row container-row">
            <br>Hogwarts Castle is a large, seven-story high building supported by magic, with a hundred and forty two
            staircases throughout its many towers and turrets and very deep dungeons.It was built in the late Early
            Middle Ages (c. 993) by a wizard architect and the four most celebrated wizards of the age: Godric
            Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin.
            <br>The castle is the main building of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, regarded as the finest
            wizarding school in the world. It is supported by magic (unable to be maintained or constructed by any other
            means) and also protected by numerous ancient spells.
            <br>Hogwarts is located in the Scottish Highlands, near the all-wizard village of Hogsmeade and not far from
            Dufftown, in Banffshire, and Achintee, in Lochaber. It was built in a valley area — surrounding mountains
            are part of the landscape — with the fairly large Great Lake to the south of the main building. The huge
            main oak front doors leading into the Entrance Hall face the west, and open up to sloping lawns. The deep
            Forbidden Forest extends around to the west of the castle. There are also exterior greenhouses and vegetable
            patches on the school grounds.<br><br>

            <br>Behind the cabin, there is the school's pumpkin patch, where the enormous pumpkins are grown for the
            school's Hallowe'en feast every year on 31 October. These pumpkins are usually carved into Jack-o-Lanterns
            and enchanted to hang from the ceiling in the Great Hall or in the corridors.<br><br>

            <br>Hogwarts has its own Quidditch Stadium where Quidditch teams could practise, hold try-outs and play
            matches against each other. Each year will see a total of six inter-house matches (each house competing for
            the Quidditch Cup), along with numerous training sessions by each house team.
            <br>The stands surrounding the pitch are decorated differently for each Quidditch match. Every second stand
            would be decorated with the colours of one team, and every other stand with the colours of the opposing
            team. Spectators would sit in between these stands.
            <br>Not far from the Stadium, there is also the flat, short-cut grassy Practice Pitch where Flying classes
            are taught to first years.
            <br>By the Stadium and the Practice is, you can find the broomshed, a small wooden building in which school
            brooms are stored, and where students can store their own broomsticks.<br><br>

            <br>The Whomping Willow is a valuable, very violent species of magical plant. It will attack anyone and

            damage to them must be treated in much the same way.
            <br>The most famous Whomping Willow is the one planted on the grounds of Hogwarts. The Whomping Willow was
            planted around the year 1971 to disguise the opening of a secret passage leading from the Hogwarts grounds
