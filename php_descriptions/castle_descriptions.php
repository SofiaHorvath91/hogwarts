Around twenty small, circular tables are crammed inside, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little pouffes.

There are hundreds of Portraits covering the walls in this tower, some of which conceal secret passages to other areas within the school. The multiple staircases in the Grand Staircase lead from platform to platform and go as high as the seventh floor where they come to an end. The stairs also have a knack for moving around the staircase chamber, usually when a student is walking up one of them. There are also many trick stairs that cause the victim to sink through a step and require another person to pull them out. However, it is second nature to most of the older students to jump them.

This bathroom holds the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. To get in the Chamber, a person needs to say 'open' in Parseltongue. This will cause the tap with a snake on the side (a tap which incidentally, never worked) to move into the floor, revealing a tunnel which leads downwards into the Chamber.">
