        <br><b>'Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor' was the founder of House Gryffindor.</b>
        <br>Much like the Hogwarts house he founded, Godric was known for his bravery and his sense of
        justice.
        <br>He was also an accomplished dueller, he even had a special silver sword created for him by
        Ragnuk the First, the finest of the goblin silversmiths, which is decorated with huge blood-red
        rubins, the color of Gryffindor, and would present itself to any true Gryffindor in a moment of
        need.
        <br>He was also famous for his fight against Muggle discrimination in the wizarding world,
        believing that any child who displayed magical abilities before their 11th birthday should be able to
        attend Hogwarts. In fact, it was a serious argument between Godric and Salazar, and though they were
        best friends, this dispute divided them, making finally the Slytherin founder leave Hogwarts.
        <br>Legend has it that Godric was also the one who gave Hogwarts the Sorting Hat, a sentient
        piece of headwear that soon became the one to sort the school’s students into houses long after Godric
        and the other founders were gone. The hat contains the intelligence of all founders, so it can pass
        on their intuition on each Hogwarts student forever.

        <br><b>‘Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad’ was the founder of House Hufflepuff.</b>
        <br> A kind and warm woman, Helga valued loyalty, patience, and hard-work above all else. She
        got along well with every founder, and Rowena Ravenclaw was her best friend, but she did not agree
        with prefering one student over another for a given skill. According to the Sorting Hat, she vowed to
        ‘teach the lot’ and she didn’t judge certain students over others, no matter how much talent
        they had or what families they came from.
        <br>It is also known that she brought the house-elves to Hogwarts, giving them shelter during
        hard medieval times.
        <br>At Hogwarts, Hufflepuff was known for her talents in Charms, and used her remarkable skills
        for preparing food – a speciality of hers – to create splendid feasts that were enjoyed by all and
        would bring the whole school together in harmony. Helga Hufflepuff’s fantastic recipes are still used
        in the Hogwarts kitchens to this day - it is her legacy that the Hogwarts feasts are always so
        triumphant.
        <br>Her portrait can be found in the Hufflepuff common room (situating next to the kitchen),
        toasting her students with her iconic golden cup engraved with a badger, the symbol of
        Hufflepuff House.

        <br><b>'Fair Ravenclaw, from glen' was the founder of House Ravenclaw.</b>
        <br>Rowena was the most brilliant witch of her time, a sharp and intelligent woman - no wonder
        that intellect and knowledge are the most highly valued assets to the students of her house. By
        calling out for the children with the highest intelligence, she wanted to make Hogwarts the very finest
        magical school on earth. To achieve this, she founded the Hogwarts library, one of the largest
        libraries of the wizarding world. It was also her who designed the moving staircases of
        Hogwarts.
        <br>Rowena was very vain about her intellect, so in order to be always the brightest of them
        all, she created a diadem, decorated with the symbol of Ravenclaw House, an eagle, that was said to
        grant wisdom to the wearer. Even after her daughter, Helena stole it from her and ran away, she
        claimed to have it until her death.
        <br>It is told that it took a long time to Rowena to forgive her daughter, but when she fell
        ill, she wanted to see her one more time, so she sent a baron, who was in love with Helena, to find
        and bring her home. Unfortunately, when he found her and Helena said no to returning with him, the
        baron killed her in his deadly rage. The legend tells us that Rowena died of a broken hearth when she
        learned the tragedy, and her diadem was lost for more than a thousand year.

        <h3 class="slytherin-text" id="slytherin-history"><br><b>SALAZAR SLYTHERIN</b><br></h3>
        <br><b>'Shrewd Slytherin, from fen' was the founder of House Slytherin.</b>
        <br>Sly and cunning, Salazar valued ambition and those students who were not afraid to use any
        means to achieve their goals.
        <br>He was a talented wizard, skilled in Legilemency and Parseltongue, and also the best friend
        of Godric Griffyndor, but he had radical views about Muggle-born students : he believed strongly
        that only wizards of pure blood (i.e., those with a mother and father from wizarding families)
        should be allowed to attend Hogwarts.
        <br>Slytherin caused great dispute over this with the other founders, and it eventually caused a
        permanent rift with Gryffindor, which led to Slytherin's departure from the school. However,
        before he left, he created the secret room, called the Chamber of Secrets, to hide a monster in
        Hogwarts that only he and his descendants can control.He predicted that the Chamber would remain a
        secret, until Slytherin’s true heir came to Hogwarts, ready to finish his ancestor’s work to clean the
        school from those who are (after Salazar) not worthy to attend there.
        <br>Though Slytherin's legacy was mostly quite twisted, he also left behind something else : A
        very distant descendant of his, Isolt Sayre, would go on to find Ilvermorny, the most famous american
        wizarding school, and Salazar’s wand would eventually be buried in the school’s grounds, turning
        into a snakewood tree with leaves with restorative powers.
